# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
In many contemporary societies, fertility rates have been steadily declining, raising significant concerns about long-term social and economic consequences. Low fertility contributes to shrinking workforces, rising dependency ratios, and increased stress on pension and healthcare systems. Despite government attempts to reverse this trend through subsidies, tax incentives, or expanded parental leave, progress remains limited. For instance, China’s fertility rate remains among the lowest in the world despite its shift from the one-child to the three-child policy, showing that demographic patterns are deeply shaped by social structures rather than short-term policy shifts.

This project explores whether gender equality—both in the labor market and within households—plays a central role in shaping fertility outcomes. Research suggests that low fertility is not simply the result of women entering the workforce, but rather the result of structural mismatches: women face rising economic independence and educational attainment, yet outdated workplace norms and unequal household responsibilities persist. When women experience the “double burden” of paid work plus unpaid domestic labor, fertility intentions tend to fall. Conversely, societies with higher gender equality and stronger family support systems often maintain higher fertility.

To examine these trends, this project compares six representative countries—Sweden, Norway, France, the United States, Japan, and South Korea—each reflecting distinct policy models and work-family norms. Through analysis of fertility rates, female labor force participation, gender inequality indices, and public spending on family benefits, the project tells a data-driven story of how institutional and cultural contexts shape reproductive choices.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

Project structure and story arc

Beginning：

Introduce the global fertility decline and its long-term socioeconomic consequences.

Highlight the common misconception that women’s employment is the main cause of low fertility.

Introduce the six selected countries as examples of four contrasting demographic models:

-Nordic model (high gender equality, strong welfare support)

-Western European model (policy-supported work–family balance)

-Liberal model (weak state support, high costs)

-East Asian model (long work hours, rigid gender norms)

Middle — Key insights from the data

Section 1: Fertility Trends (1990–2023)

Show fertility for each country and highlight diverging trajectories.

Emphasize severe declines in Japan/Korea and relative stability in Nordic countries and France.

Section 2: Female Labor Force Participation

Compare labor participation trends to show whether “more women working = fewer births” actually holds.

Reveal that high female employment can coexist with higher fertility when gender equality and childcare support are present.

Section 3: Gender Inequality (GII)

Compare structural gender inequality across countries.

Use GII to explain why fertility is most constrained in East Asia: high inequality at home + shortage of shared caregiving.

Section 4: Public Spending on Family Benefits (OECD)

Compare spending on childcare services, cash benefits, and tax breaks.

Show that countries with generous childcare and leave systems (Nordics, France) have higher fertility.

Conclusion and implications：

Summarize how gender equality, supportive policies, and work–family balance influence fertility.

Explain that fertility decline is not inevitable and it depends heavily on social and institutional support.

Suggest that successful strategies require reforms in both workplace expectations and household gender roles.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
This project uses four datasets from the World Bank, UNDP, and OECD. These datasets allow a multi-dimensional comparison of fertility, labor participation, gender inequality, and family policy spending. The fertility and labor force datasets provide long-term time series. The GII dataset captures structural gender disparities that influence fertility intentions. OECD family spending data illustrates how different welfare states support (or fail to support) parents.

Together, these datasets create a holistic picture of how gender equality, workplace structures, and public policy shape fertility outcomes. They also allow for multi-variable comparisons in Tableau, such as fertility vs. female labor force participation, or fertility vs. family spending.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.

I will create my final project using Tableau for all visualizations and Shorthand as my narrative storytelling platform. Tableau will allow me to construct clear, interactive charts comparing multiple countries across time and across variables. These visualizations will be embedded directly into Shorthand, where I will structure the story according to my outline: introducing the problem, presenting data-driven insights, and concluding with implications.
