1. Overview and Summary of Work

This final project explores why fertility rates are falling across high-income countries and what we can learn by comparing six nations with distinct social, cultural, and policy environments: France, Sweden, Norway, the United States, Japan, and South Korea.

In Part I, I developed the project concept, collected all datasets (fertility rates, female labor force participation, gender inequality index, and public spending on family benefits), drafted initial sketches, and outlined the narrative structure.

In Part II, I built the first version of the full story using Shorthand, created draft visualizations in Tableau, produced wireframes and storyboards, and conducted user research with five participants. Their feedback helped identify areas for improvement such as transitions between scenes, clarity of insights, visual consistency, and the need for explicit takeaways under each chart.

In Part III, I finalized my Shorthand story, refined visualizations, strengthened narrative clarity, added citations, and prepared my final presentation. The final deliverable reflects the full design process across all three parts and is published as a publicly accessible data story.

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

After completing Part II, I made several improvements to both the visualizations and the story structure based on user interview feedback. One change was strengthening the transitions between scenes, so readers can follow the story more smoothly. I clarified how each graph connects to or inspires the next scene, especially the jump from “employment doesn’t reduce fertility” to “structural factors like gender equality matter more.” I also added a takeaway section for every section for better understanding. 

I also revised the tone and writing style to be more approachable for a general audience. Interviewees said the earlier draft felt “too academic” in places, so I rewrote several sections(especially the graph intrepretation part) using simpler language and shorter paragraphs. I also added title for each chart to help readers interpret quickly.

Finally, I added citations under every graph, a CTA at the end, and a stronger conclusion that ties together fertility, gender inequality, and public spending. These revisions were made to strengthen both clarity and credibility.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My target audience is young adults and general readers who are increasingly exposed to discussions about low fertility on social media and in everyday life. Many people in their 20s and 30s feel pressure from work, cost of living, and social expectations, and they often wonder why having children feels harder today than in the past. Interview feedback confirmed that this group prefers clear, visual stories rather than technical explanations.

Because of this audience, I made several adjustments:

-Used simple, conversational language instead of academic terms

-Avoided demographic jargon unless necessary

-Included strong, clear insights under each graph

-Designed visuals that feel minimal and easy to scan

-Added a direct Call to Action encouraging reflection and conversation

-Explained acronyms like “GII” in one short sentence

-Included real-world context so data feels human and relatable

Personas from the interviews helped me narrow the focus: readers wanted a story that was not political or judgmental, but instead helped them understand the bigger system around fertility decline.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

Across the project, several design choices became important to the final story:

Narrative Flow

I shaped the story into five clear scenes:

1. Fertility decline

2. The common assumption about employment

3. Evidence showing the assumption is not correct

4. Gender inequality as a deeper factor

5. Public spending as the foundation that supports families

This narrative structure helps the reader move from something familiar to new evidence and to solutions.

Chart Types

I used a mix of line charts, scatterplots, and a bar chart because:

1. Line charts show long-term trends

2. Scatterplots reveal relationships that challenge common beliefs

3. Bar charts compare structural factors like public spending

Tableau allows consistent colors across all graphs

Color & Layout Choices

1. Each country keeps the same color across all visuals

2. Titles focus on the insight, not just the description

3. Annotations highlight important points (ex. Japan and Korea dropping sharply)

4. Every scene includes a final “takeaway” sentence


## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.

I used AI as a writing and editing assistant throughout the project. AI helped me clarify narrative structure, suggest transitions between scenes, polish grammar, brainstorm interview questions, and refine the wording for several paragraphs. All visual analysis, data selection, chart creation, storytelling direction, and interpretation were done by me.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

This project taught me that data storytelling is fundamentally about empathy—understanding what your audience knows, what they assume, and what might confuse them. The user interviews were especially influential in shaping a clearer, more intuitive story.

I also realized that simple visualizations are often the most powerful when paired with careful annotation. The scatterplots and bar charts are not complex, but they communicate structural insights when arranged in the right sequence.

Finally, this project helped me see how policy, gender norms, and economic structures shape individual decisions, and how data visualization can reveal these patterns in a way that words alone cannot.
