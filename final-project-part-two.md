# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

For Part II, I translated my outline into a more concrete storyboard and implemented it as a draft Shorthand story. The narrative is organized into five main scenes that guide the reader from the problem of falling fertility to possible policy responses. Each scene is anchored by at least one high-fidelity draft visualization created in Tableau. This is my shorthand link:https://preview.shorthand.com/nltcUhN6RdX0Gi74

Scene 1 – Long-run fertility trends. I open with a line chart showing total fertility rates from 1960–2023 for six countries: France, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. This scene establishes the core problem: fertility has fallen everywhere, but the depth of the decline differs sharply, with South Korea and Japan dropping to the bottom while the Nordic countries and France remain relatively higher.

Scene 2 – Rethinking the “working women” explanation. The second scene introduces the idea that many people blame falling fertility on rising female employment. I use narrative text (rather than a chart) to surface this common assumption and then contrast it with the evidence I will show next.
<img width="1468" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-26 at 7 17 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a82f4edb-76f0-4512-8a70-550cd4bee536" />


Scene 3 – Employment and fertility together. Here I use a scatterplot with a time slider (1990–2023) that plots female labor force participation on the y-axis and fertility on the x-axis. Each country appears as a dot, and the animation shows how points move over time. This visualization lets the reader see that high female employment can coexist with relatively stable fertility in countries like Sweden and Norway, while South Korea’s fertility collapses even as employment rises more slowly. The storyboard for this scene emphasises the main takeaway: employment alone cannot explain the differences.

Scene 4 – Gender inequality as a hidden factor. This scene introduces two new charts: a bar chart of the Gender Inequality Index (2023) across the six countries, and a scatterplot of gender inequality versus fertility in 2023. The storyboard notes that Norway, Sweden, and France cluster at the “more equal + higher fertility” end, while Japan and South Korea show higher inequality and the lowest fertility. The United States appears as a mid-fertility but higher-inequality outlier. The story text explains that gender roles and structural barriers matter in addition to employment.

Scene 5 – Policy support for families. The final analytic scene uses a stacked bar chart showing public spending on family benefits as a percentage of GDP, broken into cash benefits, services, and tax breaks. The storyboard highlights that France, Sweden, and Norway spend the most and provide substantial services, while Japan, South Korea, and especially the United States spend much less. The narrative connects this to the earlier fertility patterns and argues that policy support is a key lever. The conclusion scene then summarizes the argument and briefly discusses future directions and policy implications.

I have an unfinalized scene 6 for conclusion. 

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

My target audience is young adults and general readers who are increasingly curious about social challenges but do not have a formal background in demography or public policy. In recent years, falling fertility has become a widely discussed topic—both in news media and everyday conversations—as more young people express hesitation or unwillingness to have children due to financial pressure, work-life imbalance, or shifting personal priorities. Because of this growing cultural interest, I expect that anyone who has wondered why birth rates are dropping, or what might shape future family choices, could meaningfully engage with this story.

More specifically, my core audience includes:

-People in their 20s and 30s who are personally thinking about career–family trade-offs or forming opinions about whether they want children.

-University students and early-career professionals who follow social issues but may not know the underlying data.

-General readers who encounter fertility-related headlines online and want clearer, data-driven explanations rather than opinion or speculation.

To identify representative individuals for user research, I plan to recruit at least three participants from my own network—classmates at CMU, peers in other programs, and friends outside the university. These individuals are not experts in demography, but they are familiar enough with charts and news topics to provide realistic feedback about clarity and engagement. The goal is to ensure that the final story is accessible, intuitive, and relevant to a broad audience who may be curious about the issue but lacks technical knowledge.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

The goal of my user research is to understand whether the narrative is clear, whether the visualizations are readable without heavy explanation, and where readers feel confused or overloaded. I am particularly interested in whether the story successfully challenges the “working women = low fertility” assumption and whether the later scenes about gender inequality and policy support feel connected rather than sudden.

I will use a semi-structured interview format. Participants will first scroll through the draft Shorthand story on their own while thinking aloud, and then I will ask follow-up questions about specific scenes and charts.


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Check overall story clarity     |    “After reading the story once, how would you describe in your own words what this project is about?”              |
| Test understanding of Scene 1–3 link    |  “Did the transition from fertility trends to the employment + fertility scatterplot make sense? Was there any point where you felt lost?”     |
| Evaluate explanation of gender inequality     |   “In Scene 4, what did you take away from the gender inequality charts? Did they help you understand why some countries have lower fertility than others?”               |
|Evaluate understanding of policy / spending     |   “When you looked at the family spending bar chart, what was the main message you got? Did you see a connection between that chart and the fertility patterns from earlier?”              |
| Gather usability and design feedback     |   “Were there any charts, colors, or labels that were hard to read or interpret?” and “Is there anything you wish had been explained earlier or more simply?”           |



## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

I conducted interviews with three participants:

-Participant A – CMU master’s student in their mid-20s with no formal background in demography.

-Participant B – friend working in industry, late 20s, comfortable with charts but not a data specialist.

-Participant C – CMU classmate with more technical training and experience using Tableau.

Each participant scrolled through the draft Shorthand story on their own and then answered the interview questions listed in the protocol. Below I summarize the main findings by question and participant.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (unmarried, not planning kids soon, moderate interest in social issues) | Interview 2 (early-career professional in tech, interested in economic trends, unsure about having kids)| Interview 3 (graduate student, casually follows social issues, doesn’t know much about policy) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How would you describe what this story is about? | “It’s explaining why birth rates are declining and showing that it’s not simply because women work more—policies and equality matter.”   |  “It’s challenging the stereotype that working women kill fertility and showing that supportive systems can change outcomes.”            |   “It’s about how countries support families differently, which affects whether people feel able to have kids.”          |
| Where did you feel confused or lost?      |   “The transition from employment in Scene 2 to the scatterplot in Scene 3 felt a bit fast. I needed more guidance on what I was supposed to notice.”     |  “I didn’t fully get the U.S. point in the gender inequality chart. Why is it an outlier? The text could address that more clearly.”           |     “Some of the data terms were new to me—like GII. Maybe define it more clearly.”        |
| What did you take away from the gender inequality charts?      |   “Countries with more equality like Sweden and Norway seem to have higher fertility. Korea and Japan stood out as unequal and very low.”   |  “High inequality seems linked to low fertility, especially in Japan and Korea. It made sense once I thought about work pressure.”           |   “Korea and Japan seem really low in equality and fertility. It feels like a trap for women.”          |
| Reaction to the public spending chart    |   “That one was super clear. I was surprised how low the U.S. spending is.”                             |     “This was the most convincing chart. It visually shows why Scandinavian countries do better.”        |   “It helped me see why Scandinavia is always talked about as family-friendly.”          |
| Suggestions          |     “Maybe bold the key takeaway under each chart so I know what conclusion to draw.”                           |   “A short sentence before each chart saying ‘Look for…’ would help focus attention.”          |    	“Maybe add a short comparison sentence like ‘Norway spends 6 times more than the U.S.’ to make the differences feel real.”         |



# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

Based on the interview feedback, several improvements are needed to make the story clearer, more intuitive, and more engaging for a general audience. The main themes include improving transitions between scenes, simplifying technical terms, clarifying outlier cases (such as the United States), and adding clearer takeaways so viewers don’t have to interpret charts on their own. These changes will help ensure that readers not only follow the storyline but also walk away with the intended insights.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transitions—especially between the employment line chart (Scene 2) and the scatterplot (Scene 3)—felt rushed and confusing. | Add short guiding transition sentences before each new chart to frame what viewers should focus on (“Look for…”). |
| Some viewers were unfamiliar with technical terms like “Gender Inequality Index (GII).”                                         |   Add a simple one-sentence definition near the GII chart and avoid jargon in the narrative.                                                                              |
|  The role of the United States as an outlier was unclear to viewers.                                        |       Add a short caption acknowledging that the U.S. is unusual or do more research to find the reason behind                                                                      |
|  Viewers wanted clearer takeaways instead of having to interpret charts on their own.                                        |   Add bold summary statements beneath or beside each visualization (e.g., “Higher equality aligns with higher fertility”).                                                                              |
| Viewers found comparisons helpful when understanding differences in public spending.            |      Add simple quantitative comparisons (e.g., “Norway spends over 3× more than the U.S.”).                                                                           |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

Overall, the interviews confirmed that the core story is compelling and relevant, especially for young audiences concerned about social change and future family decisions. However, clarity and guidance are essential. By strengthening transitions, defining terms, acknowledging outliers, and emphasizing key takeaways, Part III can become more impactful and accessible. These changes will help ensure that the audience not only sees the data but clearly understands the message behind it: fertility outcomes improve when societies support gender equality and family-friendly policies.
